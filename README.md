# node_script [Unfinished, WIP]
A follow on from and more fleshed out version of my secondary-school Interpreter project.

Initial Foundations Progress:
- [x] [Tokeniser](https://github.com/TorinFelton/node_script/blob/master/node_script/Lexer/Tokeniser.cs)
- [ ] Parser
- [ ] Evaluator

I am still at very early stages of writing this project and therefore this README will not be detailed for now. 

This project is a continuation of the things I have learnt from my school NEA project 'Creating an Interpreter', in which I wrote a small interpreted language from scratch.
I do not plan to copy that project, but **improve on it** and **build on the knowledge I have gained from it**. This will hopefully allow me to create a language that can finally
prototype a concept I have been thinking about for a while, hence the name "node_script".
